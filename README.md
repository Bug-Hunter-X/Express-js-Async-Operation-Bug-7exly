# Express.js Asynchronous Operation Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where asynchronous operations are initiated after the response has already been sent to the client. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential errors.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route handler that attempts to perform an asynchronous operation (simulated using `setTimeout`) after sending the response.  This code will execute the async operation after the response is already sent, which is not the expected behavior in most cases. The console log will run and print, but the client will not see any changes.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct approach. The asynchronous operation is handled properly, ensuring that all necessary actions are completed before the response is sent to the client.
